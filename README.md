### myjournal

This is a simple journalling app written in Python using the Flask web framework. It started out life as the Flask tutorial app flaskr. It supports Markdown in the
journal entries, and has code syntax highlighting via pygments and the markdown2 project.

It is really more complex than required, but is a good model for a larger project. It uses
Boootstrap to make things pretty, flask-wtf for nice forms and SQLAlchemy for db stuff. It also uses flask-script so you can run it with a python shell for debugging purposes.

I consider it complete for wide definitions of complete. Branches outside `master` have
either been merged in or are currently not stable.
