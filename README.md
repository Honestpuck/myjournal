### myjournal

This is a simple journalling app written in Python using the Flask web framework. It started out life as the Flask tutorial app flaskr. It supports Markdown in the
journal entries, syntax highlighting is on the to do list.

It is really more complex than required, but is a good model for a larger project. It uses
Boootstrap to make things pretty, flask-wtf for nice forms and SQLAlchemy for db stuff. It also uses flask-script so you can run it with a python shell for debugging purposes.

I expect improvements to be fairly continual for a while. Branches outside `master` have
either been merged in or are currently not stable. Stay tuned.
